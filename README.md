# Project-Express.js-eCommerce-Platform
This project aims to build an eCommerce platform using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ORM. The platform allows users to browse, search, filter, and sort products. Users can register, authenticate, manage their profiles, and perform CRUD operations on products they own.

# Setup

    Install dependencies using npm install.
    Set up environment variables (e.g., database connection string, JWT secret, email service credentials).
    Run the application using npm start.

For development:

    Use nodemon as a dev dependency to automatically restart the server on file changes.

# Technologies Used

    Express.js
    Mongoose (MongoDB)
    Multer (for handling file uploads)
    JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
    Bcrypt (for hashing passwords)
    Express Rate Limit (for rate limiting)
    Helmet (for securing HTTP headers)
    Compression (for compressing responses)
    express-validator (For advanced request validation)
    xss (For preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing user input)
    dotenv (define your environment variables)
    emailjs || nodemailer (sending mail)

# Product Endpoints
Products

    GET /api/products: Get all products.
    GET /api/products/:id: Get a specific product by ID.
    POST /api/products: Create a new product.
    PUT /api/products/:id: Update a product.
    DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product.

# Filtering and Sorting

    GET /api/products?category=:category: Filter products by category.
    GET /api/products?sortBy=:field&order=:order: Sort products by a field in ascending or descending order.
    GET /api/products?search=:keyword: Search products by keyword.
    GET /api/products?minPrice=:minPrice&maxPrice=:maxPrice: Filter products by price range. Specify the minimum and maximum price to retrieve products within that range.
    GET /api/products?page=:page&limit=:limit: Get paginated results using MongoDB methods skip and limit.

# Advanced Features: Aggregation and Mongoose Middlewares

    GET /api/products/stats: Use MongoDB aggregation to retrieve statistics about products, such as total count, average price, or most popular categories.

Additional Tasks:

    Implement a pre-save middleware for the User model to hash the password before saving it to the database.
    Add a post-save middleware for the User model to send a welcome email to newly registered users.

With these additional features and tasks, candidates will demonstrate their proficiency in utilizing Mongoose middleware for automating tasks, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing the user experience of the application.

# User Entity

The user entity represents a registered user in the system.

    username: The unique username chosen by the user for identification.
    email: The unique email address of the user, used for authentication and communication.
    password: The hashed password chosen by the user for authentication.
    age: The age of the user.
    Country: The address of the user.
    sex: The gender of the user, which can be either "male" or "female".
    phoneNumber: The phone number of the user.
    lastLogin: The timestamp indicating the user's last login.
    Other optional profile fields: Additional information about the user such as bio, interests, etc.(optional)
    createdAt: The timestamp indicating when the user account was created.

# Product Entity

The product entity represents an item available for sale on the eCommerce platform.

    title: The title or name of the product.
    description: A brief description of the product.
    price: The price of the product.
    category: The category to which the product belongs.
    images: An array containing URLs of product images (maximum 4 images).
    owner: The user ID of the owner/seller of the product.
    stock: The number of items available in stock.
    published: A boolean value indicating whether the product is published (true) or not (false). If set to false, the product will not be visible on the platform.
    createdAt: The timestamp indicating when the product was added to the platform.

# Instructions
# Authentication and Authorization

    Implement JWT-based authentication for user registration and login.
    Ensure that only authenticated users can perform certain actions (e.g., editing their profile, adding products).

# Input Validation and Sanitization

    Utilize express-validator middleware to validate and sanitize incoming request data.
    Validate user input for registration, login, and profile updates to prevent malformed data and security vulnerabilities.

# Error Handling

    Implement error handling middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully.
    Provide informative error messages to clients for better debugging and user experience.

# Middleware

    Implement middleware functions for tasks such as authentication, request validation, and error handling.
    Ensure that middleware functions are properly organized and applied to relevant routes.

# File Uploads

    Use Multer middleware for handling file uploads, especially for product images.
    Ensure that uploaded files are properly processed, stored, and associated with the corresponding products.

# Database Operations

    Use Mongoose ORM to interact with the MongoDB database.
    Implement CRUD operations for users and products, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

# Email Confirmation

    Implement email confirmation functionality for user registration using Nodemailer or EmailJS.
    Ensure that users receive a confirmation email upon successful registration with a link to activate their accounts.

# Security Practices

    Implement security best practices such as password hashing using bcrypt to protect user passwords.
    Utilize helmet middleware to set secure HTTP headers and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

# Rate Limiting

    Implement rate-limiting middleware using express-rate-limit to protect against abusive API requests and potential DoS attacks.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Workflow
# Overview

RBAC is a method of restricting system access to authorized users based on their roles within the system. In the context of our eCommerce platform, we can define two primary # 
roles: User and Guest.

# Roles

    User: Authenticated users who interact with the platform. They can browse products, make purchases, manage their profiles, and perform other user-specific actions.

    Guest: Non-authenticated users who can browse products and view product details but cannot perform actions that require authentication, such as making purchases or managing profiles.

# Workflow for Each Role
# User

    Product Browsing:
        View product listings, categories, and details.
        Search, filter, and sort products based on preferences.

    Profile Management:
        View and update their own profile information.
        Change password and update personal details.

# Guest

    Product Browsing:
        View product listings, categories, and details.
        Search, filter, and sort products based on preferences.

# Workflow Example

    Guest Workflow:
        Guest visits the website and browses product listings.
        Guest views product details and explores different categories.

This RBAC and workflow description outlines the roles and permissions within the platform and provides a clear understanding of the actions each role can perform.

# Postman Testing

To ensure the functionality and reliability of the backend, candidates are required to structure their Postman setup effectively. Below are the key components that candidates should include in their Postman testing:

    Environment Variables: Utilize environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and base URLs. This allows for easy management and switching between different environments (e.g., development, production).

    Collections: Organize API requests into collections based on functionality or feature sets. Each collection should contain related requests and tests for specific endpoints or scenarios.

    Request Structure: Ensure that each request is properly structured with appropriate HTTP methods, headers, query parameters, request body (if applicable), and URL paths. Use descriptive names and comments to provide clarity and context.

    Documentation: Document the purpose and usage of each request and test within the collection. Include descriptions, example payloads, and any additional information necessary for understanding and maintaining the tests.

    Folder Structure: Organize collections and requests into folders to maintain a logical and hierarchical structure. This helps in managing large collections and makes it easier to navigate and locate specific requests.

By structuring their Postman setup effectively and following best practices, candidates can thoroughly test the backend API and ensure its functionality, reliability, and adherence to specifications.
